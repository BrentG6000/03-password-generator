# 03-password-generator

## Description

This is a web app that creates a random password of 8 to 128 characters long. While generating the password, this site allows the user to pick from several 
character options including numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and special characters. This app will help generate secure passwords for anyone
that wants an easy to use web interface. While creating this app, I learned how to use random number functions to pick characters from strings.

## Usage
This website can be found here: https://brentg6000.github.io/03-password-generator/

To use this web app, click the "generate password" button and then follow the instructions given to you by the alert boxes. When finished, the newly
generated password will appear in the display box in the web site.
